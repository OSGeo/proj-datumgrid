# PROJ-DATUMGRID

The files in this package can be unpacked in the PROJ data directory.
For an installed PROJ this may be /usr/local/share/proj or /usr/share/proj
on unix style operating systems.

Note that this package includes "CTable2" format grid shift files for
NAD27 in the USA and require PROJ 4.8.0 or newer.  On the plus side there
is no need to compile ascii files into binary files with this version as
CTable2 files are not system dependent (as distinct from the CTable files
produced in PROJ 4.7.0 and older).

## About the Datum Grid package

The datum grid package for PROJ is maintained on the OSGeo proj-datumgrid
repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid). Anyone cloning
it, or one of its forks, needs to install the Git Large File Storage (LFS)
extension, due to the presence of files larger than 100 MB.
Consult the [GitHub introduction to LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for
more information.

All grids in the package are released under
permissive licenses. New grids are accepted into the package as long as
they are released under a license that is compatible with the [Open Source
Definition](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated) and the source of the grid
is clearly stated and verifiable. Suitable licenses include:

  * Public domain
  * X/MIT
  * BSD 2/3/4 clause
  * CC0
  * CC-BY (v3.0 or later)
  * CC-BY-SA (v3.0 or later)

Consult [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to submit a new grid.
